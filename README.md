# Hi there, I'm Himanshu ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an engineering student at **BITS Pilani** with a deep interest in **backend development, distributed systems, and system design**.  
I enjoy building and understanding systems that prioritize **scalability, reliability, and performance optimization**.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning & Exploring
- **Rust** ðŸ¦€ â€“ strengthening my systems programming skills
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** â€“ exploring how LLMs can leverage external knowledge efficiently
- **Database Internals** â€“ studying how database systems work under the hood (storage engines, indexing, query execution)

### âš¡ Interests
- Backend architecture and **high-performance servers**
- **Distributed databases**, consistency models, and fault-tolerant systems
- Cloud-native technologies like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD pipelines**
